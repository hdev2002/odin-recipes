    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul><strong>Meat: </strong>This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Onion and garlic: </strong>An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Tomato products: </strong>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Sugar: </strong>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Spices and seasonings: </strong>This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Lasagna noodles: </strong>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Cheeses</strong>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Egg: </strong>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</ul>
